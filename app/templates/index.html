        <p class="hero-text">
          In a world increasingly dominated by machine intelligence and constant digital noise, the School of Dandori 
          offers a sanctuary for the human spirit. Founded in 2017 by technologists Ada Calm and Tessa Forman, our 
          school was born from a simple but powerful belief: as machines master our attention, humans must work to 
          reclaim it.

        <p class="info-card-text">
          Dandori is the art of managing resources efficiently to maximize output. At our school, we believe your 
          most precious resources are your time and your wellbeing.

          spaces where adults can rediscover the joy of learning without pressure, deadlines, or expectations. Each 
          class is an invitation to slow down, be present, and reconnect with what truly matters.
